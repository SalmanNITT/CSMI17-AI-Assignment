Prolog program to represent this family relationship and find out who "that man" is.
----
The riddle: 
"Brothers and sisters have I none": This means the speaker has no siblings.
"my father's son": Since the speaker has no siblings, "my father's son" refers to the speaker himself.
"that man’s father is my father’s son": This means "that man's father is me".
From this, we can deduce:
The speaker is the father of "that man".

Code:
% Define the family relationships
father(john, me).  % 'me' is the speaker
father(me, that_man).  % 'that_man' is the son of 'me'

who_is_that_man(ThatMan) :-
    father(me, ThatMan).

father(john, me).: This states that John is the father of "me".
father(me, that_man).: This states that "me" (the speaker) is the father of "that_man".
who_is_that_man(ThatMan): This rule checks who "that man" is by looking for a child of "me".
The query ?- who_is_that_man(ThatMan). will return the identity of "that man".
